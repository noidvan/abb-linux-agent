# Synology Active Backup for Business Agent — Kernel 6.15–6.18 Patches

[![DKMS module build](https://github.com/Peppershade/abb-linux-agent-6.12/actions/workflows/test-dkms.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Peppershade/abb-linux-agent-6.12/actions/workflows/test-dkms.yml)

Synology's `3.2.0-5053` release officially added support up to kernel 6.14.
Their `synosnap` DKMS module still fails to compile on 6.15 and later due to
further upstream kernel API changes — leaving users on the latest distributions
(Ubuntu 25.04/25.10) unable to back up their machines. This project patches the
module source and repackages the installer so it works again.

The version is bumped only slightly (`3.2.0-5054` over the official `3.2.0-5053`),
so when Synology eventually releases an official update with proper kernel
support, ABB will automatically install their version over this one.

## Download

Pre-built installer ready to deploy:

**[Download install.run](https://github.com/Peppershade/abb-linux-agent-6.12/releases/latest)**

```bash
sudo bash install.run
```

The installer sets up the agent and builds the `synosnap` kernel module via
DKMS, just like the official installer.

### Verified kernel versions

| Kernel | Distribution | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `6.8.0-100-generic` | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS | Verified |
| `6.12.69+deb13-amd64` | Debian 13 | Verified |
| `6.12.73+deb13-amd64` | Debian 13 | Verified |
| `6.14.0-061400-generic` | Ubuntu mainline | CI Tested |
| `6.15.0-061500-generic` | Ubuntu mainline | CI Tested |
| `6.17.0-061700-generic` | Ubuntu mainline | CI Tested |
| `6.18.0-061800-generic` | Ubuntu 25.10 | CI Tested |

**Status legend:**
- **Verified** — full install tested on real hardware; agent connected and backed up successfully
- **CI Tested** — `synosnap` module compiled successfully against mainline kernel headers in GitHub Actions; not yet confirmed with a live install

to report whether it works — this helps others and helps us track compatibility.

## Uninstall

If the DKMS module build fails or you need to remove it cleanly:

```bash
sudo dpkg --remove synosnap 2>/dev/null; sudo dkms remove synosnap/0.12.11 --all 2>/dev/null; true
```

---

## Build it yourself

If you prefer to inspect the source and build from scratch rather than
trusting a pre-built binary:

### Prerequisites

- **Linux** (native or WSL) — the build uses `dpkg-deb`, `tar`, and shell tools
- `dpkg-deb` (from `dpkg` package)
- `tar`, `gzip`
- `perl` (for binary version patching)
- `makeself` (optional — the script falls back to a manual archive method)

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install dpkg tar gzip perl
```

### Obtaining the original installer

Download the official **Synology Active Backup for Business Agent 3.2.0-5053**
Linux installer (`.run` file) from the
[Synology Download Center](https://www.synology.com/en-global/support/download).

Navigate to your NAS model, select **Desktop Utilities**, and download
*Active Backup for Business Agent* for Linux (x64 / deb).

### Building

```bash
bash build-tools/build.sh /path/to/original-install.run
```

This will:

1. Extract the official installer payload
2. Unpack the `synosnap` DEB, replace source files with patched versions
3. Repack the agent DEB with the updated version number
4. Produce a new `install.run` in the current directory

## What is patched

The `synosnap` kernel module source (`/usr/src/synosnap-0.12.11/`) is based on
Synology's `0.12.10` (from `3.2.0-5053`) and patched to handle kernel API
changes from **6.15 through 6.18**:

### Kernel 6.17+
- `freeze_super()` / `thaw_super()` gained a third `owner` argument —
  `freeze_super_3.c` feature test added, `main.c` updated with new call path

### Installer / packaging fixes
- **Debian 12+ DKMS autoinstall** — the original `postinst` stripped
  `AUTOINSTALL="yes"` from `dkms.conf` on Debian 12+, causing DKMS to refuse
  to build the module. That block is now disabled during repackaging.
- **Unloaded kernel fallback** — `genconfig.sh` hard-failed when building for
  a kernel not currently running (e.g. after a kernel upgrade or in CI).
  It now falls back to `/proc/kallsyms` with a warning instead of aborting.
- **synosnap version bump to 0.12.11** — forces reinstallation of the patched
  module on machines that already had `0.12.10` installed.
